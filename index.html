    <h1>Keyboard accessibility</h1>
    <h4>For when your designers don't like outlines</h4>
    <p>I've been in a number of roles where designers want to disable the focus rings around focusable elements because they
      don't match the design team's preferred aesthetic. However, those rings are critical for keyboard navigation and accessibility,
      since not all users can navigate the site using a mouse.</p>
    <p>Here's my compromise: Disable outlines until the user triggers a "tab" keypress, and then enable outlines after that
      point.
    </p>
    <p>You can click on the focusable elements below without showing the focus rings, but they will be available again as
      soon as you try navigating using tabs.</p>

    <button>A button</button>

    <textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>

    <p>Note: for extra picky designers, you can still override these defaults.</p>
